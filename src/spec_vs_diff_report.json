  "summary": "Most PWA requirements are implemented: manifest linked in index.html, service worker added and registered without touching immutable paths, offline UI (banner + offline.html) added, and an A2HS prompt (including iOS instructions + dismiss) added. However, the diff does not show the required PWA icon PNG assets being added, and there are unrelated feature additions (vendor portal/routes, admin/auth changes, tracking links) that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-156",
      "requirement": "Use the existing BISAULI logo as the PWA app icon set (including standard and maskable icons), and ensure the icons are referenced correctly by the manifest.",
      "reason": "The manifest references icon files under /assets/generated/, but the diff does not show the required PNG icon assets being added to the repo/public assets, so the icon set’s presence cannot be verified from the changes provided.",

    {
      "description": "Admin/authentication behavior changes (e.g., admin panel accessible without auth, removed admin token verification hook)",
