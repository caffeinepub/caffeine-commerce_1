  "summary": "REQ-39 appears implemented by wiring the Admin “Access Denied” screen’s “Back to Login” button to an explicit navigate({ to: '/admin/login' }) flow. REQ-40 is not evidenced in the diff: the admin login UI and frontend/README.md updates communicating default username `admin` and URL `/admin/login` are not shown. The diff also introduces broader token-based admin login/logout behaviors that were not requested and may conflict with stated non-goals.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-40",
      "requirement": "Admin login UI displays the default username as `admin` and does not contradict it elsewhere in the UI.",
      "reason": "The provided AdminLoginPage snippet shows generic copy (e.g., \"Enter your credentials\" and a username placeholder \"Enter username\"), but no explicit in-app text stating the default username is `admin`. The file is truncated, so there is no reliable evidence this was added.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals explicitly include not changing the admin authentication mechanism/token issuance; requirements only ask to fix navigation and clarify default credentials. The diff shows new/expanded login mechanics and token storage logic beyond those requirements.",
