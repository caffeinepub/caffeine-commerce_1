  "summary": "Admin panel branding is set to \"BISAULI\"; top priority is fixing admin dashboard functionality by disabling all backend admin-only authorization checks (since /admin login is removed) so anyone accessing /admin can add/delete categories and products, and resolving the backend outage where the backend canister is stopped (IC0508) causing CRUD (e.g., adding category \"cloths\") to fail; then redeploy and verify all admin dashboard pages load and CRUD works without unauthorized/rejection errors.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Cross-platform mobile app (Android + iOS) with clean, minimal UI inspired by Amazon/Flipkart.",
    "Backend to use Firebase or Supabase, including secure authentication, real-time database updates, and cloud image storage.",
    "Payments must support Razorpay, Stripe, and Cash on Delivery.",
    "Include admin panel capabilities for catalog/order/user management and sales analytics.",
    "Seed the app with 3 sample products (including image URLs or bundled placeholder assets) to demonstrate add-to-cart flow and cart badge count in header.",
    "Admin panel authentication must use a simple username/password login (no Internet Identity) with secure credential storage and session/token-based access control for admin routes/APIs.",
    "Admin credentials need a defined reset/default-password process for deployment; user requested resetting the admin password and redeploying to restore access.",
    "Admin dashboard should include a 'Site Settings' section for branding (shop name + logo upload/change).",
    "Branding/shop name must be set to \"BISAULI\" and reflected both in the shopper header UI and in SEO title metadata (document title / meta tags).",
    "Temporarily disable admin authentication and route gating: remove /admin/login requirement and allow direct access to /admin (no username/password) until re-enabled later."

  "known_issues": [
    "Automated build for the smart search feature failed with: “AI couldn't process your request successfully. Try simplifying or rewording it.”",
    "Admin panel deployment/build failed (deployment encountered an error); needs fix and redeploy so draft is accessible.",
    "On the Access Denied page, the “Back to login” button/link is broken and does not navigate to the admin login form; needs link/route fix.",
    "Admin password is unknown/not set from the user's perspective; requires password reset and redeploy to restore admin access.",
    "Admin login page shows: \"Admin login is not yet configured on the backend\"; backend admin username/password login logic needs to be implemented/configured so credentials (admin / Admin@123) work.",
    "Branding/shop name reverted back to \"Canfinity Store\" after deployment; must be fixed so \"BISAULI\" persists permanently.",
    "Admin login remains invalid after deployment; user requests temporarily removing admin login and all password protection.",
    "Admin Products page shows \"Something went wrong!\" when opened; likely backend/actor/database connection failure preventing listing/CRUD so admin cannot add items.",
    "Admin Categories page has the same backend/actor/database connection failure; needs fix so categories can be managed.",
    "Admin \"Site Settings\" page is not working as expected (logo upload/change flow failing); needs fix so branding/logo can be updated."
