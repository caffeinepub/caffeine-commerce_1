    "Include admin panel capabilities for catalog/order/user management and sales analytics.",
    "Seed the app with 3 sample products (including image URLs or bundled placeholder assets) to demonstrate add-to-cart flow and cart badge count in header.",
    "Admin panel authentication must use a simple username/password login (no Internet Identity) with secure credential storage and session/token-based access control for admin routes/APIs.",
    "Admin credentials need a defined reset/default-password process for deployment; user requested resetting the admin password and redeploying to restore access.",
